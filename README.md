Hello. I'm a first year student pursuing a bachelors in Computer Science from FAST-NU Lahore.
I want to eventually found a tech startup after I'm done with my degree, and have a bit of experience.
I like AI, and software development along with web development, because all the aforementioned allow me to build **real**, ***tangible*** things.
I'm currently learning the MERN stack and getting used to programming in js.
Hit me up if you have any advice for me, thank you. ðŸ–¤
